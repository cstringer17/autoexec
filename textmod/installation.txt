1. Choose which version you want (GoBananas or Normal)
2. Move "csgo_bananagaming.txt" inside this folder: Steam\SteamApps\Common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\resource
3. Add -language bananagaming in launch options
4. Restart your game & enjoy

Not working? Make sure that:
- csgo_bananagaming.txt is placed in the right folder (it needs to be inside the resource folder)
- Launch options is spelled correctly, this is an example that will work:
-novid -language bananagaming -tickrate 128
